SeaGoat Vision
==============

This repo contains all of the code that is meant to be run on the autonomy computer. The autonomy computer responsible for the following:
		
		-Vision
		-Guidance
		-Mission Level Planning

The motivation is to abstract the low level autonomy so that mission level behaviors can be programmed quickly and easily. 

		-/harness_tests: Contains experimental code for new algorithms and functions
		-/image_data_set: The image data set can be downloaded from the drive it contains data sets that I generated myself and  sets donated by various schools
		-/mission: Contains mission level code
		-/sea_goat_vision: Contians low level algorithm implementations and other utility functions
