Autonomy: Autonmy vision code

Embedded Code: This was intendded to contain the code that would go onboard the STM32. However, MBED released an update that stopped supporting GCC for STM32F4. At which point all the code in this directory became depricated. I would suggest moving away from mbed because there is very poor support for STM32F4 I would suggest moving towards ST suppored libraries.
